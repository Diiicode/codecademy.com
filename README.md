# Codecademy ðŸ’»âœ¨

> Tracking my learning journey on Codecademy â€” **C**, **Bash**, and **applied cybersecurity**. This repo gathers exercises, miniâ€‘projects, and notes as I move through relevant Codecademy paths.

## ðŸ“Œ Focus

C Â· Bash Â· Unix fundamentals Â· systems programming basics Â· securityâ€‘minded practices.

## ðŸ“š Contents (no strict order)

* **C Fundamentals** â€” types, control flow, functions.
* **Pointers & Memory** â€” arrays, pointer arithmetic, dynamic allocation.
* **Strings & I/O** â€” safe string handling, files, CLI args.
* **Data Structures & Algorithms** â€” lists, stacks/queues, sorting/search.
* **File I/O & Parsing** â€” scanners, simple formats, error handling.
* **Bash Basics** â€” variables, conditionals, loops, functions.
* **Text Processing** â€” `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `cut`, `sort`, `xargs`.
* **Processes & Pipelines** â€” redirection, pipes, job control.
* **Linux Permissions** â€” users/groups, `chmod`, `umask`.
* **Networking Basics** â€” sockets at a high level, `curl`, HTTP basics.
* **Debugging & Tooling** â€” `gdb`, `valgrind`, sanitizers (when applicable).
* **Security Basics** â€” input validation, bounds checks, least privilege.


## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

* Build strong foundations in C and Bash with clean, readable code.
* Practice secure coding habits and careful error handling.
* Turn lessons into small, reusable tools and concise writeâ€‘ups.
* Document progress clearly and iterate with feedback.

## ðŸ§­ Approach

* **Style**: C99 with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`; small functions; explicit returns.
* **Safety**: prefer bounded ops; check every return value; guard against UB.
* **Quality**: add examples/tests where useful; use `gdb`/`valgrind` for nonâ€‘trivial C.
* **Ethics**: share original solutions and insights; avoid posting paid content verbatim.

## âš¡ About Codecademy

**Codecademy** offers interactive programming courses and projects. Iâ€™m using it as a structured guide while building extra practice and tools here. (See codecademy.com for more.)
